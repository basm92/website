      <description>Introduction The newest versions of the dplyr package introduced a new function, across(), to be used within summarise, mutate and filter functions, and I am trying to learn it. I am, however, having a hard time understanding the use and the mechanics of the function in combination with filter.

The same is true for several non-official guides that I have read.</description>

      <description>Introduction This is the first blog post on my own website. I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to make this website using the R package blogdown. The website looks very nice now (in my humble opinion), but it was tedious to make. When attempting to create the website, I first tried out a couple of themes before I settled on the basic &amp;ldquo;lithium&amp;rdquo; theme, because it was by far the easiest theme to wrap your head around.</description>
