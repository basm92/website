      <description>Introduction In this post, I will briefly explain how to read in a table easily from the Indonesian data sources that I have been planning to use (see here). First, I download the file, containing data about municipalities in every province and their GRDP:
download.file(&amp;quot;https://www.bps.go.id/publication/download.html?nrbvfeve=OTgxMmExYzRlYTI1Mjk4MDA0ODM5NTk2&amp;amp;xzmn=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnBzLmdvLmlkL3B1YmxpY2F0aW9uLzIwMTkvMTAvMDQvOTgxMmExYzRlYTI1Mjk4MDA0ODM5NTk2L3Byb2R1ay1kb21lc3Rpay1yZWdpb25hbC1icnV0by1rYWJ1cGF0ZW4ta290YS1kaS1pbmRvbmVzaWEtMjAxNC0yMDE4Lmh0bWw%3D&amp;amp;twoadfnoarfeauf=MjAyMC0wNS0zMSAyMzo0Njo1Ng%3D%3D&amp;quot;, destfile = &amp;quot;hello.pdf&amp;quot;)  Reading in the table There are different ways in which I can read the table. First, I use the tabulizer package, from which I can use the extract_tables function, with two arguments:</description>

      <title>Batch Downloading with RSelenium</title>

      <description>Introduction In this blogpost, I briefly explain how to batch download files in RSelenium. This can be super useful if you want to download some pdf’s or other files, but you don’t want to click ‘download’ a 1000 times, and there is no other option available.
 Step 1: Setting up a Docker Container In this case, we have to deviate from the standard case of setting up a Docker container.</description>

      <description>Introduction In this blogpost, I want to tell you about web scraping using RSelenium, something which I’ve recently been learning and which I am very enthusiastic about, because it is very powerful. I want to do this in the context of an example. I have been supervising undergraduate students, and a group of students asked me where they could get a list of members of the Iranian parliament. So I went to the official English-language website of the Iranian parliament, and looked up the list of members.</description>

      <title>R vs. Excel: A Quick Comparison</title>

      <description>Introduction and link to .pdf Once upon a time, I wrote a small pamphlet called &amp;lsquo;R vs. Excel: A quick comparison&amp;rsquo; aimed at former or current Excel users to convince them to take up R, and leave aside Microsoft Excel entirely. I think the pamphlet contains some good arguments, so you can read about it here.</description>

      <title>Dplyr: filtering with across</title>
      <link>/2020/05/17/dplyr-filtering-with-across/</link>

      <guid>/2020/05/17/dplyr-filtering-with-across/</guid>
      <description>Introduction The newest versions of the dplyr package introduced a new function, across(), to be used within summarise, mutate and filter functions, and I am trying to learn it. I am, however, having a hard time understanding the use and the mechanics of the function in combination with filter. While this vignette has ample examples on mutate and summarise, the examples on filter are few and not very insightful. The same is true for several non-official guides that I have read.</description>

      <title>First post: Making a website with blogdown</title>
      <link>/2020/05/17/first-post-making-a-website-with-blogdown/</link>

      <guid>/2020/05/17/first-post-making-a-website-with-blogdown/</guid>
      <description>Introduction This is the first blog post on my own website. I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to make this website using the R package blogdown. The website looks very nice now (in my humble opinion), but it was tedious to make. When attempting to create the website, I first tried out a couple of themes before I settled on the basic &amp;ldquo;lithium&amp;rdquo; theme, because it was by far the easiest theme to wrap your head around.</description>
