class: inverse

# The Rules

  - Teams have a maximum of 4 members
    - use a separate Teams chat to communicate rather than this channel 
  - No shouting out the correct answers
    - but you can definitely keep on your microphone and make fun of us
  - No life lines: we’re not Who Wants to Be a Millionaire
    - and we could not afford their prize money
  - The quizmaster is always right
    - we’re in the Humanities so there’s no such thing as a ground truth anyways

---

class: inverse

# The Rules

  - Five rounds, one answer form per round
    - Links provided per round
    - Each round features a different theme

  - One team member per team filling out the answer forms

  - Please use the same e-mail address each round!
  
  - If there are multiple "good" (or commonly accepted) answers to a question, we will accept them! :)
