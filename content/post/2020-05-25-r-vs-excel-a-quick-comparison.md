# Introduction and link to .pdf

Once upon a time, I wrote a small pamphlet called 'R vs. Excel: A quick comparison' aimed at former or current Excel users to convince them to take up R, and leave aside Microsoft Excel entirely. I think the pamphlet contains some good arguments, so you can read about it [here](/R_vs__Excel__A_Simple_Comparison.pdf).
