<h1>Introduction</h1>
<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 2fr 1fr; grid-column-gap: 30px;">
<div>
<p>I am a PhD Candidate in Economic History at Utrecht University, and I am on the job market. My PhD research attempts to combine archival research, econometric methods, historical insights and economic theory to investigate the influence of personal wealth on the voting behavior of the Dutch political elite in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It also focuses on the personal financial returns to politics, and the drivers of democratization of the Netherlands. In addition, I work on the effects of workers mobilization on politicians and electorates in the Netherlands, and I am investigating the long-term effects of Dutch firms in Indonesia. I also work part-time at Erasmus University (the Netherlands), where I supervise theses in Finance.</p>

<h1>Research Interests</h1>
<p>My research interests encompass economic history, political economy and institutional economics. I also love methodology and statistics, programming and web design. Over time, I created and maintain a number of R packages, which you can access <a href="/packages"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>

<div id="this-website" class="section level1">
<h1>This website</h1>
<p>This website shows some of my present work, and serves as a pathway to several data repositories and guides that I have written. It will also serve as an access point to <a href="/classes"><strong>Course Material</strong></a> that I provide. Furthermore, I will write a blog post every once in a while, about things that interest me. Sometimes, these posts are more of a reminder to myself about how to do something. I guess these will be mostly data-related, but feel free to browse around for anything.</p>
