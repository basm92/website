<p>I am a PhD Candidate in Economic History at Utrecht University, and a supervisor of MSc and BSc theses at Erasmus University (the Netherlands). My PhD research focuses on the drivers of democratization of the Netherlands in the late 19th and early 20th century, and focuses on the incentives of Dutch political elites. I also work on political rent-seeking in the context of both active and passive suffrage expansion, and I am investigating the effect of political connections in firms in colonial Indonesia.</p>
