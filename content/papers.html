<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Economists frequently assert that politicians derive financial returns from a political career, but it is unclear what allows them to do so. In this paper, I derive estimates of the returns to consecutive lower house mandates exploiting the repeated treatment assignment resulting from Dutch district-level elections (1860-1917). Based on newly-collected data from probate inventories, I obtain a measure of personal wealth for a sample of just-elected politicians and their losing contenders. Using a dynamic regression discontinuity methodology, I document that politicians’ returns to politics are concentrated in the first period of political activity. The results show that politicians who were elected once accumulated wealth with a rate that is about 5% higher than their nearly-elected counterparts. I also investigate the role of political parties in constraining politicians’ ability to benefit financially from their political career. I find that after the establishment of political parties, there is only limited evidence of politicians being able to profit from their political career, suggesting political parties discipline politicians’ in-oﬀice behavior.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In the context of inclusive economic development, politicians play a potentially facilitating or obstructing role. In this study, I analyze the effect of Dutch politicians’ personal interests on the acceptance of a number of important reforms in an era of democratization and rapid economic growth (1870-1920). More precisely, I analyze whether Dutch politicians prioritized their self-interest in a number of roll-call votes establishing fiscal legislation potentially impacting their personal wealth. Using newly-collected archival data and instrumental variable estimation for politicians’ personal wealth, I find convincing evidence that wealthier politicians are less likely to vote in favor of legislation that is likely to decrease their own personal wealth, controlling for a wide array of electoral characteristics. The results also show that these effects are absent in important laws that do not have a direct impact on politicians’ wealth, such as votes on suffrage extension and other government intervention. The results are robust to many different assumptions and estimation procedures.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Using newly-collected archival data, this study investigates the wealth and investment portfolio’s of Dutch politicians from 1870 to 1922. In a period when the political and economic situation underwent many changes, this study finds that the political arena remains rather static: politicians are wealthy in comparison to the average citizen. Secondly, upper house members are by far the wealthiest politicians followed by executives. Lower house politicians are the poorest on average, consistent with the lower house being accessible by the entire male population of the country. Finally, there is no strong trend towards a more equal representation of the Dutch population in the nineteenth century, but towards the 1920’s, a substantial number of poorer politicians was elected and politicians of all kinds were significantly less wealthy than their predecessors. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study detailing the trajectory of personal wealth of politicians in the Netherlands in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.</p>

<h3>The Influence of Worker Mobilization on Electoral and Politicians’ Decisions (WIP)</h3>
<p>[Joint with Kieran Marray, Stanislav Avdeev]</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We investigate whether worker mobilization in the form of strikes influences voting behavior of incumbent politicians in the context of attempts to extend the franchise in the Netherlands (1887, 1892, 1896). Using a difference-in-differences setup, we also investigate whether the occurrence and frequency of strikes in an electoral district has an impact on the propensity of the electorate to vote for liberal or Christian politicians in an era in which suffrage extension was on the political agenda. We expand this set-up to investigate the influence of strikes on electoral results in a panel of municipalities spanning the entire twentieth century. Finally, we provide a theoretical justification for the empirical results by sketching out a small formal model explaining why incumbent politicians may be more inclined to vote in favor of suffrage extensions when faced with more strikes in their district.</p>

<h3>The Consequences of Military Conscription (WIP)</h3>
<p>In this paper, we exploit random variation in allocation of conscription to identify the effects of military conscription on career opportunities, the access to financial networks, and consequently, personal wealth.</p>

<h3>Political Connections in Colonial Indonesia (WIP)</h3>
<p>After the abolition of the coercive <em>Cultuurstelsel</em>, Dutch and other firms were freely allowed to start commercial operations in Indonesia. In this paper, I investigate the long-term effect of the presence of Dutch firms in colonial Indonesia.</p>
