<p>Here are some links to some of the R packages I have created:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.github.com/basm92/Clio">Clio</a></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Clio</code> is a package that facilitates the usage of the <a href="http://www.clio-infra.eu">Clio-Infra</a> database. It helps the user extract data based on simple queries, instead of repeatedly downloading Excel files. In addition, it facilitates reproducible research by explicitly documenting data collection.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://github.com/basm92/hdng">hdng</a></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><code>hdng</code> is a package that serves as an interface for the <a href="https://datasets.iisg.amsterdam/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=hdl:10622/RPBVK4">HDNG Database</a>. It allows the user to browse and search through the data, and submit queries to obtain data in an organized manner. The query can be customized to condition on year, municipality, and several other options enhancing user comfort are included.</p>
