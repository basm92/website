</div> I am a PhD Candidate in Economic History at Utrecht University, and a supervisor of MSc and BSc theses at Erasmus University (the Netherlands). My PhD research focuses on the drivers of democratization of the Netherlands in the late 19th and early 20th century, and focuses on the incentives of Dutch political elites. I also work on political rent-seeking in the context of both active and passive suffrage expansion, and I am investigating the effect of political connections in firms in colonial Indonesia. 

# Research Interests 

My research interests encompass economic history, political economy, political history, institutional economics and corporate finance. I also love programming and web design, and in particular, I love R. Over time, I created and maintained a number of R packages, which you can access [**here**](/packages). 


# This website

This website shows some of my work over time, and serves as a pathway to several data repositories and guides that I have written. It will also serve as an access point to [**Course Material**](/courses). Furthermore, I will include a blog post every once in a while.
