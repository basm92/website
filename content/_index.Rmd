# Introduction

:::: {style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 2fr 1fr; grid-column-gap: 30px;"}

::: {}

I am a PhD Candidate in Economic History at Utrecht University, and a part-time supervisor of MSc and BSc theses at Erasmus University (the Netherlands). My PhD research attempts to combine archival research, econometric methods, historical insights and economic theory to investigate the wealth and investment profile of the Dutch political elite in the late 19th and early 20th century, the drivers of democratization of the Netherlands, and focuses on the incentives of Dutch political elites. In addition, I work on political rent-seeking in the context of both active and passive suffrage expansion in late 19th-century the Netherlands, and I am investigating the effect of Dutch firms in Indonesia: I focus on their political connections, and the long-term development consequences of these colonial firms.

# Research Interests 

My research interests encompass economic history, political economy, political history, institutional economics and corporate finance. I also love methodology and statistics, programming and web design, and in particular, I love R. Over time, I created and maintain a number of R packages, which you can access [**here**](/packages). 


# This website

This website shows some of my present work, and serves as a pathway to several data repositories and guides that I have written. It will also serve as an access point to [**Course Material**](/classes) that I provide. Furthermore, I will write a blog post every once in a while, about things that interest me. Sometimes, these posts are more of a reminder to myself about how to do something. I guess these will be mostly data-related, but feel free to browse around for anything.
